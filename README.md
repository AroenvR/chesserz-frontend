Mental note of where I want to go with this.

A chess game with the following functionalities:
2 players, each able to move their respective color chess pieces.

White goes first, alternating turns.

MVP:
Game is over when players click "end game"
No enforcement of how pieces can move
Only enforcement is pieces cannot leave the board.
Board generated with ?? CSS?
Two Java classes will hold the data of which piece is where.

Host on GitHub Pages.

Add authentication.

Add turn takebacks.
Add spectating.

Add tests.

Add Solid? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3Bx5vxKl0&list=PL79cCuKIPiehhSFedeWNTENHHJkRFve6s&index=61&ab_channel=Fireship
